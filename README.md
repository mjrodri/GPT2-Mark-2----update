# Chatbot GUI Project

This simple chatbot GUI application allows users to interact with a GPT-2 language model. Users can input text, receive responses, and view the conversation in a chatbox.

## Features
- Real-time interaction with a GPT-2 chatbot.
- User-friendly GUI for seamless communication.
- Graceful error handling during model initialization.
- Threading for enhanced GUI responsiveness.
- Modular code structure with a `Chatbot` class.

## Improvements
1. **Error Handling:** Improved robustness by gracefully handling potential GPT-2 model and tokenizer loading failures.

2. **Threading:** Enhanced user experience with threading, preventing GUI freezing during model response generation.

3. **Modularization:** Organized code structure with a dedicated `Chatbot` class, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.

4. **Clean Entry Point:** The main entry point creates instances of both `Chatbot` and `ChatbotGUI` classes, resulting in a cleaner and more organized codebase.

5. **Print Statements:** Suggested strategic print statements for debugging, aiding in the identification of potential issues.

## Getting Started
1. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the application: `python chatbot_gui.py`
